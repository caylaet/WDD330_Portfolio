          <li>parstInt() and isNaN() are global methods</li>
          <li>alert() stops the program to produce a dialog box that displays a message and waits for the user to close it </li>
          <li>confirm() stops the program to ask the user a question that they can confrim or cancel</li>
          <li>prompt() asks the user something that they can provide input than click ok or cancel</li>
          <li>Try to avoid using alert, confirm, and prompt as they will stop all code until the user clicks</li>
