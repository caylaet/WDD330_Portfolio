    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation - the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the 'on' button. In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowitâ€™s done.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism - the same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
        <li>Inheritance - taking the features of one object then adding some new features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
        <li>Prototype is used to add to a class after it has been initialized and should only include variables or methods common to all.</li>
        <li>make a variable private declare it (using let) within the class and than use getters and setters.</li>
        <li>Use the Extends keyword to create a class based off of another class. the keywordsuperrefers to the parent class </li>
        <li>monkey-patching - is adding funtion to classes that are already defined in Javascript. It is not recomened to do so.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty">Property Descriptors</a></li>
        <li> Mixins are to mixin different objects together and create a has-a relationship. They do not create a chain of inheritance. </li>
        <li>When nesting funcitons be aware of the "this", try using arrow funcitons instead, presetting it in a variable or useing the bind().</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_call.asp">Call()</a></li>
        <li>Composition over inheritance sees objects as building blocks that go together to make other objects rather than classes that are monolithic structures layered on top of each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 15 </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Moduler JavaScript is the idea of creating seperate files of code that relate to a specific topic and than importing them in as needed.</li>
