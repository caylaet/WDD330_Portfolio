    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>You mentioned in the meeting about the Javascript gotcha, where if it is loaded first
            it may not even work. When I was working on the practice or walkthrough code, that I posted 
            above, I had my Javascript at the top like they had in the book but it didn't work until I moved
            it down to the bottom. I am still unclear as to why it didn't work? Also is there a time that we would
            want to put it at the top or should we get in the habit of always putting our script that the bottom?
        </p>
