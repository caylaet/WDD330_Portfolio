    <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fetch is a new way of getting and sending information accross the network.</li>
        <li>At its basic from fetch is used like this: fetch(link to were you are getting or sending infromation).then(What you are going to do with the respose) </li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch">This</a> is a good link for more information on supplying more options with your request.</li>
        <li>You can upload JSON data, a file or even multiple files (using FormData()) using fetch.</li>
        <li>Fetch only rejects the promise if a network error occured so you need to check that the respose was ok before handling the promise </li>
        <li>You can create a request header that you than pass through fetch. </li>
        <li>You can pass another request object into a request object and it will create a copy of it.</li>
        <li>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor. With the headers object you can query the header.</li>
        <li> Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are resolved. The response contains response.status, response.statusText, response.ok and a body data which can contain differnt data</li>
